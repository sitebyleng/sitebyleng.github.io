		<h2>High School</h2>
		<p> I'm planning to go Lakewood and continue the Atm program.</p>
			
		
		<h2>College</h2>
			<p>While most museums are a collection of old artifacts and stuff that no one is really interested in seeing, our musuems are the best of the best.</p>
			<p>You won't find anything like these any where else in the world. Our museums rival that of our closest competitors including the Museum of Bad Art, the Paris Sewers Musuem and the Museum of Broken Relationships.</p>
			<p>Come check them out...the fun is waiting for you.</p>

			<h2>Career Interests</h2>
			<p>For my career I would like to end up being an artist hairstyler because I really like doing hair. Right now I know how to do some braids. On my trip, we had parties and I did most of my family hair and gave me good feedback.</p>
